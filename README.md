# DD2424 Deep Learning in Data Science
This is the official git repository for our project work in the course DD2424.

## Evaluating chess positions utilizing Convolutional Neural Networks
The core idea of this project is to implement a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) which evaluates any given chess position. The training and testing will be done by utilizing the well established open source chess engine 'Stockfish' version 13.
